# Full ozen schema

In my opinion, we can keep this scheme public. 
Because open source also keep backend structure in public. 
So it shouldn't be a problem.
From this we can use url to raw file in config files for each proj. Full config will be in seperate repo/folder/anywhere.
And independent api can generate client for communication.
