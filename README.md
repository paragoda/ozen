# OZEN
Cross Platform ORM. Access your data from anywhere with same dx.

## Requirements

### Basic funtionality should be super easy to setup
If I don't need extend main server I don't want ever clone repo to my machine. Just make something like config file:
```bash
ozen new
```
this will create repo/proj of basic ozen server
```js 
// ozen.json
{
    owner: 'org-or-user-name',
    repo: 'main-server',
    lang: 'rust',
    db: {
        type: 'mysql',
        connectionStrEnv: 'OZEN_DB_CONNECTION_STR' // will take this string from .env file
    }
    host: 'fly.io', // generate docker file
}
```
.env
```env
OZEN_DB_CONNECTION_STR=secret-connection-string
```

### Extendable
Should be able to extend server as usual backend.

---
### Only nessasary
It's about all:
1. fetch from client only nessasary data
2. get from db only nessasary data on server
3. keep on server only things that are used in runtime
4. generate client/server sdk/orm only for required tables
5. auth only if required
6. no autogenerated columns in table

Keep all as minimum as possible. But, at the same time, not sacrifice opportunities for minimal.

---
### Independent
Each sdk must not be connected with framework or even db connector. But of course Ozen will have fast start, where already will be backend framework abd db connector, so you shouldn't do it by yourself. At the same time I want add posibility to use ozen in with any framework or db connector.
