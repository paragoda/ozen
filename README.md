Cross Platform ORM + Backend. Access your data from anywhere with same dx.

## c1 Minimal
It's about all:
1. fetch from client only nessasary data
2. get from db only nessasary data on server
3. keep on server only things that are used in runtime
4. generate client/server sdk/orm only for required tables
5. auth only if required
6. no autogenerated columns in table
Keep all as minimum as possible. But, at the same time, not sacrifice opportunities for minimal.

## c2 Independent
Each sdk must not be connected with framework, db connector, lang. But of course Ozen will have quick start, where already will be backend framework and db connector, so you shouldn't do it by yourself. At the same time I want add posibility to use ozen with any framework or db connector. Should be able to extend server as usual backend.

---
## c3 Typesafe
It's all about SDK outside layer (under the hood it can be not so typesafe).
Return object will have only specified fields, and you see it during development, not runtime.

---
## c4 Exception free
Error is returned as one of the possible values like in Rust, ...
Something like this, but i am not sure exactly.
```ts
function result<T>(): [T, null] | [null, Error]
function result<T>(): [T, true] | [Error, false]
```

## c5 Easy *normal* DX
*Normal*, because sweet dx should not limit opportunities. 
But still it should be understandable, not hard to write.
And of course [c3](#c3-typesafe) is also part of DX.
Basic funtionality should be super easy to setup.
If I don't need to extend main server I don't want ever touch server code.

---
## c6 Fast
It should be as fast as possible. Especially backend part, which will be only for us, not for devs. 
We can make ugly code for performance reasons. Because a lot of small optimizations lead to much more performance in general. So that's why we will need a lot of comments. SDK can have this only under the hood [c5](#c5-easy-normal-dx).
